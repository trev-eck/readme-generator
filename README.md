## Description
The goal of this project was to create a command line based application that can create a comprehensive readme file based on user input. The user is prompted with a series of questions to gather the necessary information and then writes the formatted data to a new file. The project makes use of Node and the inquirer package to display questions in the terminal. This readme was created using the program described.
    
## Installation Instructions
